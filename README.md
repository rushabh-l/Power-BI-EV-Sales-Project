# Power-BI-EV-Sales-Project

Hello everyone.

Here I have introduced my EV Sales Analysis Project using Power BI tool. 
The above repository contains the Datasets (dim_date,sales_by_maker,sales_by_state). All datasets are in CSV format
The meta data file includes the information about the descriptions for the columns in the CSV files related to electric vehicle sales data. These datasets include sales by state, sales by maker, and a date dimension table useful for time-series analysis.
The primary and secondary business questions includes 10 preliminary questions and 6 secondary questions.
